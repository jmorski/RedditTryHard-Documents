## The Code

We don't have a super strict code of conduct here, but to keep everything civil (and everyone sane) there are a few guidelines everyone must follow.

For most people, these rules won't be a problem. If you violate one, we'll probably just point it out nicely. If you continue to violate these rules after sufficient warning, or if you really go off the deep end and do something serious, you may be suspended, demoted, put on probation, or dismissed entirely. The disciplinary process is outlined in its own section.

### Activity requirements
Since this is an active clan, we expect active members. We log hours played for each member during Clan Wars to measure activity levels. 

#### TRYb
Failure to meet activity requirements will result in a one-war suspension from TRYb, during which the member will need to meet rSFT minimum requirements to earn their TRYb spot back.

- 6 hours played in-game during 5-day Platinum wars (~6 hours of real time)
- 4 hours played in-game during Diamond wars (~6 hours of real time)

#### rSFT
Failure to meet activity requirements will result in a one-war suspension, served on the rSFT inactive roster. After one war has passed, the member will return to the active roster.

- 6 hours played in-game during 5-day Platinum wars (~10 hours of real time)

### Conduct

#### GroupMe chats
- The primary purpose for chat is coordination for Clan Wars. Separate chats will usually be created for each clan during wars only. Respect the topic and keep non-war discussions out of those groups.
- In casual (non-war) groups, you're free to discuss almost anything. Please keep out explicit pornography or links, gore or NSFL content or discussion, illegal drug or activities (things you wouldn't want reported to the police), threats, and bullying.
- As a close-knit group, discussions will contain lots of banter, teasing, and joking. This should always be in good fun, being mindful of the line between fun and hurtful that could be crossed. If you think you might have been out of line, apologize and tone it down a notch.
- Swearing is generally accepted, but try to refrain from using explicitly racial or sexual terms or phrases (e.g. rape) in a joking or pejorative manner. Sexual or explicit jokes at another's expense are fun until they cross a line; know that line.
- Do not post personal information about another person, including their real name, address, contact info, or anything else they might not want public, without their consent.
- Keep your name in the casual and war groups reasonably close to your PSN gamertag and console(s). We reserve the right to force a name change at any time.

#### In-game conduct
TRYb and rSFT want to be competitive; video games wouldn't be fun without some competition and challenge. But at our core we're a casual set of players that don't want to take it all too seriously.

- Do not rage in any match, public or private. We all get frustrated, and that's fine. Don't take it out on your fellow players, don't complain about weapons or tactics someone else might be using, and don't rage quit a match. Ever.
- Be a team player. Coordinate with other players on your team, especially in objective games. Don't get upset if things don't go our way all the time.
- No cheating, hacking, dashboarding, modding, boosting, or other tactics used to unfairly increase your success in the game. Cheating of any sort is grounds for immediate dismissal from the clan, potentially without a prior warning.
- During Clan Wars, play as a group and follow direction. Our strength lies in our group strategy. A running back would never second-guess the quarterback's play call in the huddle. Similarly, clan leadership's play calls shouldn't be second-guessed in the war chat. Listen to your clan leadership. We value everyone's input, but if leadership decides on a strategy it's important that everyone comply and help out. 

#### On the subreddit
- Do not post personally identifying information about anyone, ever, unless they've given consent.
- Keep the same rules as GroupMe chat for the subreddit.
- Accept new members as you would any existing member. Keep in mind the history you may have with our clan, and remember how it might feel to join a group like ours not knowing anyone or understanding our jokes. Welcome new people warmly.
- Keep Clan War strategy and tactics discussions off the subreddit. Other clans **will** search for us, find the subreddit, and get important info without us knowing.

#### Elsewhere
As a member of a Reddit TryHard clan, you'll be expected to represent our brand according to our conduct guidelines. When interacting with someone from outside of our clan (an opponent in-game, another clan on Twitter, official CoD personnel, etc.), you will be held to the same standards outlined above.

### Discipline

For the most part, you'll be given at least one warning before any disciplinary steps are taken. Continued infraction of our rules is grounds for suspension, demotion, probation, or dismissal from our clans.

We can't be everywhere at once or know everything that goes on. If you've noticed a potential Code violation, or you've been on the receiving end of behavior that you think is unacceptable, bring it to the attention of one of the clan leaders.

#### Leadership discussion
The process to discipline a clan member starts with the entire leadership team.

1. A Code infraction has occurred, following prior actions or history of misconduct, and one of the clan leaders proposes a response.
2. Among clan leaders, the infraction and any potential disciplinary actions are discussed at length, usually for a period of a day or two. This helps diminish reactions based on emotion, allows for a fact-gathering process, and permits all leaders across the world to weigh in.
3. If necessary, a vote among clan leaders may be taken on the matter. This vote would be non-binding, restricted to clan leaders, and generally anonymous. 
4. Clan leaders will determine the next step: no action, a warning, probation, or dismissal.

#### No action
Clan leadership may determine that no disciplinary action will be taken. This is the most likely course of action for one-time, non-serious violations. We take all reports seriously, but our members are generally receptive to direct feedback from another member.

This also may include a friendly reminder to a member about a specific rule, without that rising to the level of an official warning.

#### Warning
Violations of the Code that are more serious or persistent may warrant an official warning. One or more leadership members will deliver this warning directly, and the warning will be given on behalf of the entire leadership team.

There are not a set maximum number of warnings before dismissal, but we will tend to follow a "three strikes" rule. 

#### Probation
If a member's actions are deemed serious enough for dismissal, but not serious enough for a permanent dismissal, leadership may put a member on probation for any amount of time up to three months. This member will be ineligible to compete in Clan Wars, and may be removed from GroupMe chats.

Probation for TRYb members may consist of a demotion, whereby the clan member must meet minimum requirements in a future rSFT war to earn their TRYb spot back.

#### Dismissal
If a violation is serious enough, or after sufficient warning(s) have been given, a member may need to be dismissed from our clans.

This decision will be made with discretion to the process, without publicly listing the dismissed member's infractions. 

After dismissal steps have been completed by the leadership team, an announcement will be posted to the subreddit for at least a day. This may serve as the only notice of dismissal to the clan.
