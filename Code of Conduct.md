We don't have a super strict code of conduct here, but to keep everything civil (and everyone sane) there are a few guidelines everyone should follow.

### GroupMe Chats
- The primary purpose for chat is coordination for Clan Wars. Separate chats will usually be created for each clan during wars only. Respect the topic and keep non-war discussions out of those groups.
- In casual (non-war) groups, you're free to discuss almost anything. Please keep out explicit pornography or links, gore or NSFL content or discussion, illegal drug or activities (things you wouldn't want reported to the police), threats, and bullying.
- As a close-knit group, discussions will contain lots of banter, teasing, and joking. This should always be in good fun, being mindful of the line between fun and hurtful that could be crossed. If you think you might have been out of line, apologize and tone it down a notch.
- Swearing is generally accepted, but try to refrain from using explicitly racial or sexual terms or phrases (e.g. rape). Also, sexual or explicit jokes at another's expense are fun until they cross a line; know that line.
- Do not post personal information about another person—including name, address, contact info, or anything else they might not want public—without their consent.
Anyone not following those rules after sufficient warning may be removed from the chat and/or the clan.

### In-game conduct
TRYb and rSFT want to be competitive; video games wouldn't be fun without some competition and challenge. But at our core we're a casual set of players that don't want to take it all too seriously.

- Do not rage in any match, public or private. We all get frustrated, and that's fine. Don't take it out on your fellow players, don't complain about weapons or tactics someone else might be using, and don't rage quit. Ever.
- Be a team player. Coordinate with other players on your team, especially in objective games. Don't get upset if things don't go our way all the time.
- No cheating, hacking, dashboarding, modding, boosting, or other tactics used to unfairly increase your success in the game. Cheating of any sort is grounds for immediate dismissal from the clan.
- During Clan Wars, play as a group. Our strength lies in our group strategy. We value everyone's input, but if leadership decides on a strategy it's important that everyone comply and help out. Listen to your clan leadership.

### On the subreddit
- Do not post personally identifying information about anyone, ever, unless they've given consent.
- Keep the same rules as GroupMe chat for the subreddit.
- Accept new members as you would any existing member. Keep in mind the history you may have with our clan, and remember how it might feel to join a group like ours not knowing anyone or understanding our jokes. Welcome new people.
- Keep specific Clan War strategy and tactics discussions off the subreddit. Other clans will search for us, find the subreddit, and get important info without us knowing.

These aren't hard rules, but all are grounds for suspension, demotion, or removal from our clans.
